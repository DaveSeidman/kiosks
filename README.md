# Interactive Kiosk classes
This is an actionscript library of classes I've developed for interactive kiosks

# Usage
Most of these classes are for doing specific things on screen when a user interacts with a touchscreen or mouse.

# Compatability
Most of these classes will work in any published SWF however some functionality may be dependant upon running in a publish AIR or EXE application.
